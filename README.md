# Lake Mapper

Lake Mapper is a simple SwiftUI app for mapping lake depths. It lets you drop waypoints on a map and edit them later in a list view.

## Usage

1. Longâ€‘press on the map to drop a waypoint or use the form to enter exact coordinates and depth.
2. Switch between the map and the list of waypoints using the menu button.
3. In the list view you can edit or delete each waypoint.
4. Each marker displays the entered depth in metres.

This demo uses `MapKit` for displaying the map but it can be adapted to use the Google Maps SDK if desired.
