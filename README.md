# Lake Mapper

Lake Mapper is a simple SwiftUI app for mapping lake depths. It lets you add waypoints with depth information and visualise them on a map.

## Usage

1. Enter the latitude, longitude and depth for a waypoint in the form at the bottom of the screen.
2. Tap **Add** to place a marker on the map.
3. Each marker displays the entered depth in metres.

This demo uses `MapKit` for displaying the map but it can be adapted to use the Google Maps SDK if desired.
